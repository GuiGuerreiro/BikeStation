# BikeStation

This was the final project of my first programming course in Eletrical and Computer Engineering BSc at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.
The program reads from a .csv that gathers all bike trips info and then displays stats and a map showing routes and station status.
This project was done in pairs.

Grade: 18/20
